/// Native regex find-and-replace over a text message body — the engine
/// behind ``MITMOperation/bodyReplace`` (import operation id `6`). It is the
/// body-side analog of ``MITMOperation/urlReplace``: a compiled ``Regex``
/// matched anywhere in the body, with each match swapped for the **literal**
/// replacement string (no `$1` capture expansion — the substitution goes
/// through `String.replacing(_:with:)`).
///
/// **Bytes in, bytes out.** ``applyAll`` decodes the body as UTF-8 once,
/// applies every compiled edit in rule order against the running string, and
/// re-encodes once. The contract is **total / fail-closed**, matching
/// ``MITMJSONPatch``: a body that isn't valid UTF-8 yields the body
/// **unchanged**, and a search that matches nothing is simply a no-op — a
/// rewrite rule routinely fires on a response whose bytes it doesn't fully
/// control, and corrupting the wire there would be worse than doing nothing.
