/// (an `async function process(ctx)`) calls `Anywhere.http.get` / `post` /
/// `request`, which ``MITMScriptEngine`` routes here.
///
/// ### Loopback
/// Requests go out as the Network Extension's **own** `URLSession` traffic,
/// which the kernel keeps out of the tunnel the extension manages — so a
/// script fetch does not loop back through the MITM (the same bypass
/// ``RawTCPSocket`` relies on for upstream sockets). DNS resolves on the
/// physical interface for the extension's own queries, so no special routing
/// is needed here.
///
/// Each call gets its own ephemeral `URLSession` so per-request redirect and
/// TLS-trust policy can differ without a shared cookie jar; the session is
/// invalidated once its task settles.
