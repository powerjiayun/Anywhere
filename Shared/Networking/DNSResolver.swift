/// Thread-safe DNS cache for hostnames resolved outside the VPN tunnel — used
/// for both upstream proxy servers and direct-routed destinations. Always
/// resolves through the physical network interface via `getaddrinfo`, bypassing
/// the VPN tunnel to avoid routing loops.
///
/// Stale entries are returned immediately on TTL expiry and refreshed in the
/// background, so connect paths never block on DNS for previously-seen hosts.
/// Concurrent stale hits on the same hostname coalesce into one background
/// refresh. `forceFresh: true` overrides the stale-fast path for callers that
/// need accuracy (e.g. latency tests).
///
/// The cache is kept small by its TTL, not by its size: the resolver is a
/// process-lifetime singleton, so it must shed entries as they age rather than
/// hoarding every host ever resolved — a real memory concern in the
/// Network Extension, and one that would otherwise make ``refresh`` re-resolve
/// thousands of dead hosts on a path change. ``compactUnlocked`` drops an entry
/// once it has been expired longer than ``staleServeWindow``; it runs on the
/// write path (so the cache is swept exactly when it grows) and in ``refresh``.
/// An actively-used host is refreshed on access and never reaches the cutoff,
/// so cleanup only ever removes hosts that have gone quiet. ``maxEntries`` is a
/// pure backstop for a burst that outruns cleanup. Reads stay lock-shared — the
/// hit path never writes.
